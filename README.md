# HalloweenHideout

Halloween Hideout is a 2D iOS platformer centered around surviving Halloween night, from the hours of 7 pm to 7 am. The game will consist of levels taking place at different times in the game and will get progressively harder. Throughout the playerâ€™s journey, they will collect candy pieces with a value ranging from one (1) to fifteen (15). These candy pieces will be used in the in-game store to buy costumes that will randomly appear throughout the levels.  The player will be able to run, jump, and attack to clear the levels and complete the game.
